# Spring Boot Observability in Practice: Actuator, Micrometer, and OpenTelemetry

We’ve all been there: something goes wrong in production, and the logs don’t tell the whole story. In this talk, we go beyond basic health checks and show how Spring Boot Actuator and Micrometer help you build applications that are not just functional, but also transparent, diagnosable, and production-ready.

Through practical examples, we enable and customize Actuator endpoints to gain real-time insights into your application's state. We collect metrics with Micrometer and export them to Prometheus. We also visualize metrics and set up alerts in Grafana.

Another focus is integrating OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing across multiple services. We close with best practices for embedding observability into your development process in a sustainable way.

Whether you work locally or in Kubernetes, this session shows how to improve the observability of your Spring Boot application without getting lost in technical complexity.
